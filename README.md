## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
I chose to build the application by starting with a general sketch of the application on paper. I sketched out the layout and general flow of the application, attempting to follow the given example pictures as closely as possible. I chose to use Material-UI for the styling because it offers easy and fast options for styling an application. Material Design is useful because it is well documented, regularly updated, consistent and flexible. My goal was to follow the guidlines as closely as possible while creating a simple, effective and unique application. I achieved all requirments and also was able to impliment a search capability for the application. 

## Are there any improvments you could make to your submission? 
If I had more time I would have liked to improve the search functionality to re-order the shown movies or series instead of creating a new component with the searched value. I would also like to have done more extensive testing. 

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time? 
If I had more time I would accomplish the two things I mentioned in the previous question. I also would have probably approached the application with a test driven development style
